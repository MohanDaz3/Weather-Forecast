# Weather Forecast Project

## Overview

This project is a weather forecasting application that provides real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. It includes a frontend built with React and Vite, and a backend built with Node.js and Express. The backend uses PostgreSQL for data storage, managed through Prisma ORM.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.0.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) for PostgreSQL management
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecast.git
cd weather-forecast

Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

npm install

This command installs both the backend and frontend dependencies using concurrently.
Set Up PostgreSQL with pgAdmin
Open pgAdmin and connect to your PostgreSQL server.

Create a new database for the project:

Right-click on Databases and select Create > Database.
Name the database (e.g., weather_forecast).
Create a new user with appropriate permissions:

Right-click on Login/Group Roles and select Create > Login/Group Role.
Enter the username (e.g., weather_user) and set a password.
Under the Privileges tab, give the user the necessary privileges for the new database.
Update the database URL in the .env file (see below for details).

Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

DATABASE_URL=postgres://weather_user:yourpassword@localhost:5432/weather_forecast
Replace yourpassword with the password you set for the weather_user,

Run Migrations
After setting up the database, run the following command to apply the Prisma migrations:

cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev

Running the Project
To start both the frontend and backend servers, run:

npm start

This command uses concurrently to run the frontend and backend scripts simultaneously.

Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend: http://localhost:5000
